# Anchor is built around the following components:

- Programs: A program (smart contract) runs on Solana. It contains your business logic and is deployed to the blockchain.
- Accounts: Solana's programs interact with accounts, which are data structures stored on-chain. Anchor simplifies account serialization and deserialization.
- Instruction Handlers: Instruction handlers are functions within the #[program] module that define what your program can do, e.g., creating or updating accounts.
- Seeds and PDAs : Anchor helps you generate Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for managing account ownership and uniqueness.

# Important Features in Anchor

#  PDA (Program Derived Addresses)
- Use PDAs for deterministic account addresses:
- ``let (pda, bump) = Pubkey::find_program_address(&[b"seed"], program_id);``

# Error Handling

- Anchor provides error handling with custom error types:
#[error_code]
pub enum MyError {
    #[msg("Custom error message")]
    CustomError,
}


# Event Emission
- Anchor can emit events for tracking on-chain actions:

#[event]
pub struct MyEvent {
    pub data: u64,
}


# Constraints
- Define constraints on accounts to ensure program security:

#[account(mut, has_one = owner)]
pub my_account: Account<'info, MyAccount>,


# Once you're comfortable with these basics, you can explore advanced topics like multisig wallets, governance programs, or DeFi protocols.
